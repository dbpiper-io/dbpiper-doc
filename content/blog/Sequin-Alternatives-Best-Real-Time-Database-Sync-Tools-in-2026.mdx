## Sequin Customer Success Stories

### Case Study: SaaS Startup Migrated to DBPiper

"We were paying Sequin $200/month. Stacksync quoted us $1200/month, which wasn't feasible for our budget. 

We switched to DBPiper at $29/month and got the same real-time sync we needed. Setup took 12 minutes. Migration was seamless with their free support.

Saved us $2,000+/year while maintaining the same functionality."

— Alex Chen, CTO at [Startup Name]
